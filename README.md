# Superstore-Sales-EDA

## Introduction

In this project, we conducted exploratory data analysis on sales, profit, consumer, and product data for our favorite (imaginary) superstore, Superstore! Various insights were extracted using SQL (MySQL) and subsequently visualized on a Tableau dashboard. These insights can be used to identify opporunities to increase revenue and profits and pinpoint areas/products for divestment.
